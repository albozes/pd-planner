## Introduction

A simple app to plan out scenes for the Playdate retro-style game console on a precision pixel level. It's being built using the Open Source Godot Engine, which has powerful UI capabilities and is compatible with every major OS and platform.

## Installing / Running PD Planner

There is currently no standalone build because I'm too early in development, so you'll have to use it inside Godot.
Other than [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/), this project has no requirements. If the Godot Engine runs on your computer, so will PD Planner!

Simply git clone this repo.

    git clone [path/to/offerman.py](https://github.com/albozes/pd-planner/tree/main)

Then open it the same way you would any Godot project.
