## Introduction

A simple app to plan out scenes for the Playdate retro-style game console on a precision pixel level. It's being built using the Open Source Godot Engine, which has powerful UI capabilities and is compatible with every major OS and platform.

## Installing / Running PD Planner

There is currently no standalone build because I'm too early in development, so you'll have to use it inside Godot.
